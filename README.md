# HexRPG Widget

I spend a ton of time playing a game called HexRPG and theres a ton of tasks that are made much easier with the smallest bit of automation. This script is written just for that, and it is completely frontend based since I do not have access to the backend of the application.

Currently using this script you can:
- Export a csv of the current stock prices
- Buy lottery tickets in bulk

Currently planned features in no particular order:
- Bet managers that will place a bet upon certain conditions  (this will be partially dependent on whether I ever get this deployed to Heroku so the widget can be run on a consistent schedule like the bets themselves)
- Automated plum manager who will manage your plums daily (somewhat dependent on Heroku and if I can figure out how to send a radio response from a request library. Mostly done at this point.)
- Daily money optimizer (mostly a time thing, this one will be super easy to knock out)
- Activate lottery tickets in bulk (same problem I am having with the plumGuide where radio menus are thwarting me)
- Automate weekly visit to the lake (Heroku again. I really should work on this :P)
- Whatever else I can think of in the interim period.
